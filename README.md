# Work Day Planner
 
## Purpose
A website that allows a user to plan out their work day. The day planner is organized with three columns. The first displays the time from nine o'clock to five o'clock. The second column serves as containers for text so that the user can enter in what they would like to schedule for the hour. The third column is a save button that when clicked the users text input will save and then persist on their planner.

The date is displayed just underneath the title of the webpage. This date updates regularly and will display the current date. The user is able to edit the middle column to enter in text that they want to have scheduled for the hour. This same column will change it's color based upon its relationship to time. If the current hour matches the scheduled hour, the corresponding column cell will be red. If the hour is in the past, the cell will be grey, If the hour is still in the future, the cell will be green. If the user wants to save an entered task, they will need to click the blue save button in the last column. Once clicked the text entered in the second column will be saved to local storage. When the page is reloaded the entered text will be displayed in the correct cells.
